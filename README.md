> **Mission Objective:** A mature federated OSS ecosystem operating under passive sustainment governance, emphasizing chaos engineering, rollback survivability, split-brain tolerance, and continuous operational verification.

Welcome to the **long-term operational nexus** of the `dev-utility-lab` telemetry grids. This repository ensures resilience through continuous automated fault injection and rigorous partition recovery benchmarking.

## 🔬 Core Chaos Engineering & Resilience Operations

### 1. Failure Simulation & Containment
- **Chaos Runbooks:** Continuous validation against network partitions via our `CHAOS_TEST_RUNBOOKS.md`.
- **Dependency Circuit-Breakers:** Zero-trust isolation of third-party anomalies governed by `DEPENDENCY_CONTAINMENT.md`.

### 2. Survivability & Recovery SLAs
- **MTTR Benchmarking:** Enforced recovery velocity SLAs preventing drift (`RECOVERY_TIME_BENCHMARKS.md`).
- **Observability Fallbacks:** Structured logging persistency ensuring auditability even when primary sinks degrade completely.

### 3. Passive Sustainment Resilience
- **Automated Degradation Triage:** Safely failing closed to protect LTS branch validity during transient CI upstream drops.

## 🤝 Contributor Notes
This architecture is strictly checked against fault-tolerance matrices. When proposing structural changes, ensure your telemetry payloads pass the fallback validations and do not artificially inflate MTTR drift variables.
